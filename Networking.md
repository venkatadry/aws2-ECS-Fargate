# ECS Networking Overview

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) provides several networking options to connect your containers:

## Key Networking Modes

1. **AWS VPC Networking**
   - Containers get their own elastic network interface (ENI) and private IP address
   - Runs directly in your VPC
   - Best for when you need fine-grained network control

2. **Bridge Networking**
   - Traditional Docker bridge networking
   - Containers share the host's ENI
   - Good for simpler use cases

3. **Host Networking**
   - Containers use the host's network stack directly
   - Bypasses Docker networking
   - Best for performance-sensitive applications

## Key Components

- **Service Discovery**: Integrated with AWS Cloud Map for service registration/discovery
- **Load Balancing**: Works with ALB, NLB, and ELB
- **Security Groups**: Apply at the task level for VPC networking
- **Network Policies**: Control traffic between tasks

## Advanced Features

- **PrivateLink**: Secure access to ECS services from other VPCs
- **App Mesh**: Service mesh integration for advanced networking
- **Task Networking**: Each task can have its own security group and ENI

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of ECS networking?
