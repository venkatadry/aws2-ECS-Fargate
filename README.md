**Introduction**

**Amazon ECS** is a container orchestration platform developed by AWS that allows you to easily run, scale, and secure Docker containers on the AWS cloud. Unlike Kubernetes-based systems such as Amazon EKS, ECS is proprietary and tightly coupled with the AWS ecosystem.

An ECS cluster refers to a group of resources that Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) manages for running containerized applications. It's the core unit where ECS places and manages tasks and services.

Key Concepts of an ECS Cluster:
Definition:

An ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services.

You can run it using either:

**Fargate:** serverless compute—no need to manage infrastructure.

**EC2:** you manage the instances (virtual machines) yourself

This article not only introduces ECS and its architecture but also demonstrates how to deploy a simple Flask-based containerized application using **AWS Fargate** — a serverless compute engine for containers.
________________________________________
**Why ECS When We Have Docker?**

Docker is great for building and running containers, but it lacks features required in production environments like:

•	**Auto healing**: Restart containers automatically if they crash.

•	**Auto scaling**: Handle varying traffic loads by adjusting the number of container instances.

•	**Service discovery & networking**: Dynamically manage IPs and connect services.

These limitations necessitate orchestration tools like **ECS** and **Kubernetes**.
________________________________________
**Limitations of Docker Without Orchestration**

Let’s understand Docker’s shortcomings that ECS or Kubernetes solves:

•	**Lack of Auto Healing**:

o	If a container is deleted or crashes, Docker doesn’t restart it.

o	This causes **application downtime**.

•	**No Auto Scaling**:

o	Docker alone cannot scale containers when traffic spikes (e.g., during a festival).

o	Manual scaling is error-prone and inefficient.

•	**IP Instability**:

o	Re-created containers receive different IPs.

o	Leads to broken connections or failed service discovery.
________________________________________
**The Rise of Container Orchestration**

Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes (K8s) and ECS emerged to solve the above challenges. Kubernetes introduced powerful features like:

•	Controllers for **auto healing**

•	Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) for **auto scaling**

•	**Service discovery** and stable networking

•	**Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** for extensibility

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration with an open-source, community-driven approach.
________________________________________
**Why Did AWS Build ECS?**

Despite Kubernetes' popularity, AWS developed ECS to offer a **simplified, AWS-native** container orchestration experience. ECS:

•	Does not depend on Kubernetes

•	Offers AWS-specific constructs like:

o	Task Definitions

o	Tasks

o	Services

o	Clusters

•	Supports **Fargate (serverless)** and **EC2 (server-based)** launch types

However, ECS is **not open source** and is tightly coupled to AWS, making migration to other clouds more difficult.

**ECS vs Kubernetes (EKS)**

| Feature                  | ECS                         | Kubernetes (EKS)           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Open Source              | No                          | Yes                        |
| Cloud Agnostic           | No                          | Yes                        |
| Custom Resources (CRD)   | No                          | Yes                        |
| Community Support        | Limited                     | Extensive                  |
| Ecosystem Tools          | Limited                     | Vast (ArgoCD, Istio, etc.) |
| Learning Curve           | Simple                      | Steep                      |
| Multi-cloud Portability  | Poor                        | Excellent                  |

**When to use ECS:**

•	You want a simple and fully managed container platform

•	You are tightly coupled with AWS

•	You prefer **Fargate** for serverless containers

**When to use EKS/Kubernetes:**

•	You require advanced orchestration features

•	You plan for multi-cloud/hybrid cloud deployments

•	You want to use open-source tools and extensions
________________________________________
**ECS Core Concepts**

Here are the key ECS components and their roles:

•	**Cluster**: Logical grouping of tasks and services

•	**Task Definition**: Blueprint for your container (image, ports, CPU/memory, env variables,volume)
     you can run multiple tasks using one task definition

•	**Task**: Running instance of a task definition

•	**Service**: Defines long-running tasks, integrates with load balancers, enables auto scaling
   ECSservice wil spin up the task when it goes down
   ECSservice will maintain ECS Tasks
________________________________________
**Deploying Your First ECS Application (Using Fargate)**

**Prerequisites:**

•	AWS account with ECS & ECR access

•	Docker & AWS CLI installed locally

•	Sample Flask app

**1. Build and Push Docker Image to ECR**

```sh
# Authenticate with ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | \
docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Build Docker image
docker build -t ecs-flask-app .

# Tag image
docker tag ecs-flask-app:latest <your-account>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ecs-flask-app:latest

# Push image to ECR
docker push <your-account>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ecs-flask-app:latest
```

**2. Create ECS Cluster**

•	Go to AWS Console → ECS → Create Cluster

•	Choose **Fargate**

•	Name your cluster (e.g., demo-ecs-cluster)

**3. Create Task Definition**

•	Go to ECS → Task Definitions → Create

•	Choose **Fargate**

•	Define container info:

o	Name: flask-app

o	Image: <your ECR image URI>

o	Port: 3000

•	Configure logs to **CloudWatch**

**4. Run Task**

•	ECS → Clusters → Select your cluster → Run Task

•	Choose launch type as **Fargate**

•	Select task definition and run

**5. Verify Logs**

•	Navigate to **CloudWatch Logs**

•	Confirm the application is running successfully on Port 3000
________________________________________
**Best Practices**

•	Use **Fargate** to simplify infrastructure management

•	Integrate **CloudWatch** for centralized log management

•	Use **ECR** for container image storage to leverage IAM and performance

•	Clean up ECS resources after testing to avoid unexpected charges

•	For production, configure:

o	IAM Roles for Task Execution

o	Auto scaling policies

o	Application Load Balancer with ECS Services

Project
Micro service(spring boot) -->Create docker image-->push docker imge to ECR-->Run image in ECS
Above spring boot 3 it supports only java 17


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c41ea2-0733-4afe-8690-dfd71e9e1f42)
We have to create  ajar file
```
FROM openjdk:17-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
COPY target/docker-example-microservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar docker-example.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/docker-example.jar"]

Push the image to ECR repository
you can enable kms key for encryption for docker image or else it uses default

Scan on push---?vulnerability scanning
Enable scan on push to have each image automatically scanned after being pushed to a repository. If disabled, each image scan must be manually started to get scan results.
```
Have access key and secret for uploading docker image
you need to login to docker ECR to upload images
```
🔐 Docker ECR Authentication
The Docker ECR login is handled like this:
#aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com
Explanation:
aws ecr get-login-password: This generates a temporary password (an authentication token) valid for 12 hours.

--username AWS: This is a fixed value — always use AWS as the username for ECR.

--password-stdin: Securely passes the password/token to Docker via standard input.

You never need to manually retrieve or manage a username or password. AWS manages that securely through the CLI.

once docker image is pushed to ECR
go to ECS
cluster-->create cluster-->give cluster name
Networking-->select vpc, you can select subnets
you can select type of cluster Extternal instances using ecs anywhere/AWS fargate/Amazaon ec2 instances
create autoscaling group

Monitoring
Eanble use container insights
CloudWatch automatically collects metrics for many resources, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, that you use to isolate issues and resolve them quickly. You can also set CloudWatch alarms on metrics that Container Insights collects.

done

Go to Task Definitions--?Create  a TASK definition
Task Definition Family - <give name of task definition>
you can run multiple containers with single task definition
you can add environment variables/ give a file which contains all
you can add health checks

you need to create a task role.if your service is accessing other service then we ned a role for that
enable log collection

A Task Execution Role for Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is an IAM role that grants ECS tasks the permissions they need to pull container images from Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and to write logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

▸ Service auto scaling - optional
Automatically adjust your service's deseed count up and down within a specified range in response to CloudWatch alarms. You can modify your service auto scaling configuration at any time to meet the needs of your application.
you can also select loadbalancing group

Here's how to create a typical Task Execution Role for ECS with ECR access:

✅ 1. Create the IAM Role (via Console or CLI)
You can name it something like ecsTaskExecutionRole.

✅ 2. Attach the Required Trust Relationship
This allows ECS tasks to assume the role:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
✅ 3. Attach the Required IAM Policies
Use the managed policy AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy. This grants permissions to:

Pull container images from ECR

Write logs to CloudWatch Logs

Access secrets from AWS Secrets Manager or SSM (if configured)

bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
This includes permissions like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
    "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
    "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
    "ecr:BatchGetImage",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
✅ 4. Reference the Role in Your Task Definition
In the ECS task definition JSON/YAML:

json
Copy
Edit
"executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"
This is separate from the taskRoleArn, which gives the container runtime access to AWS services.
